SMTP Redirector + Stripping Email Headers

## Setting up Relay Mail Server

I am going to set up a mail server that will be later used as an SMTP relay server. First off, a new Ubuntu droplet was created in Digital Ocean:

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="https://2603957456-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-LFEMnER3fywgFHoroYn%2F-LNtFmkK7kGlg24jlYCr%2F-LNtHTCAG4xhsu7hw2Wj%2Fsmtp-relay-droplet.png?alt=media&token=f3a95c99-2e7b-450d-bf70-6d8e46501a2b" style="width:'100%%'"/></div>

<br/>

Postfix MTA was installed on the droplet with:\\

```
apt-get install postfix
```

During postfix installation, I set `nodspot.com` as the mail name. After the installation, this can be checked/changed here:

```
root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-sfo2-01:~# cat /etc/mailname
nodspot.com
```
